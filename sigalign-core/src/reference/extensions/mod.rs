/*!
Supplementary functionalities for the `Reference`.

This module houses auxiliary features that can be utilized by `Reference` given the proper implementation by `SequenceStorage` or `PatternIndex`. For instance, if both `SequenceStorage` and `PatternIndex` support the [Serialize] trait, a `Reference` defined by these implementations can benefit from serialization and deserialization.
